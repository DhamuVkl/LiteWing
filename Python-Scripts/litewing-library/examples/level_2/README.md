# Level 2 — Flight Control

Learn to fly! These examples progress from LEDs (safe, no motors)
through your first flight to movement and data logging.

| # | Script | What it teaches |
|---|--------|-----------------|
| 01 | `01_led_control.py` | Solid colors, blinking, turning off LEDs |
| 02 | `02_basic_flight.py` | Arm → takeoff → hover → land |
| 03 | `03_tuning_config.py` | Adjusting height, thrust, PID gains |
| 04 | `04_movement_commands.py` | Flying a square with forward/right/backward/left |
| 05 | `05_data_logging.py` | Recording flight data to CSV |

## ⚠️ Safety

- Always test LEDs FIRST (01) before flying
- Keep target_height low (0.3m) for first flights
- Clear 2m × 2m of space around the drone
- Stay at least 1 meter away during flight
- Know where `emergency_stop()` is!
