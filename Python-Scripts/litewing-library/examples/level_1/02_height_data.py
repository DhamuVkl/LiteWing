"""
Level 1 — Read Height Data
============================
Connect to the drone and read height from the VL53L1x ToF laser:
  - stateEstimate.z (Kalman-filtered height estimate)
  - range.zrange    (raw ToF laser measurement)

What you'll learn:
    - Two different ways to read height (raw vs filtered)
    - How the Kalman filter smooths the raw ToF reading
    - Reading live sensor data
