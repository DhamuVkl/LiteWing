"""
Level 1 — Read Position & Velocity Data
==========================================
Connect to the drone and read optical flow-based position
and velocity estimates.

What you'll learn:
    - Dead reckoning: how position is estimated from optical flow
    - Velocity measurement from optical flow sensor
    - X and Y axes and what they mean
    - Raw vs processed sensor data

Note: Position and velocity readings are most meaningful when
the drone is in the air. On the ground, optical flow may give
noisy readings depending on surface texture.
