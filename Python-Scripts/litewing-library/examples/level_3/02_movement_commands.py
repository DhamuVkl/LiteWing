"""
Level 2 — Movement Commands
=============================
Fly a square pattern using movement commands.

What you'll learn:
    - forward(), backward(), left(), right()
    - Combining movements into a pattern
    - The fly() helper for safe automated flights

 SAFETY: Make sure you have at least 2m × 2m of clear space!
