"""
LiteWing Example — Tier 2: Intermediate
==========================================
Sensor reading, trim tuning, data logging, and manual control.

What you'll learn:
    - Reading and printing live sensor data
    - Adjusting trim to correct drift
    - Recording flight data to CSV
    - Using manual (joystick) control with position hold

# If your drone drifts forward, add negative trim_forward.
# If it drifts right, add negative trim_right.
drone.trim_forward = 0.0   # Adjust this based on testing
drone.trim_right = 0.0     # Adjust this based on testing

# === Data Logging ===
# Enable automatic CSV logging — creates a file with position, velocity,
# and correction data that you can plot in Excel or Python.

# === Sensor & Height ===
drone.target_height = 0.3   # Hover at 30cm

# === Manual Control Example ===
# Switch between two hold modes to feel the difference:
drone.hold_mode = "current"  # Try changing to "origin"
drone.sensitivity = 0.2     # How fast the drone responds to keys
